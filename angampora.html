              Angam is believed to have been a part of the ancient culture of Sri Lanka that dates back to over 5000 years. It has been carried down from generation to generation, standing the formidable test of time, and once became an indispensable part of the Sri Lankan way of life.
            </p>
            <p>
              For centuries the country went through multitudes of great trials that required its men to muster defences with the help of their fellow countrymen, to battle invasions that came from long foreign lands as a common fervor within. The monarchy maintained a reasonable sized army that consisted of full-time soldiers, but the majority of countrymen were ready to answer the call to arms in the time of King Dutugemunu. Hence Masters of Angam were scattered around the island and imparted their knowledge in a different level or dimension that was a simple, potent, and effective form of close quarter combat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of the fear that the British and their Pillars in the time banned and outlawed the practice of Angam as a threat and therefore it almost went underground, masked in rural dance forms in order to ensure it remained impervious, which resulted in the practice of the art dying out in the colonial era of Sri Lanka by the British as it lasted for more than 450 years. Due to this situation, Angam practices were spread singularly among a select few. Most Gurus (masters) refrained from teaching, but very few families that were dedicated to the preservation of the art, carried it forward.

              Hand to hand Combat, which is commonly known as “Angam pora,” has its distinct meaning:
              <strong>“Angam”</strong> refers to the body, while <strong>“Pora”</strong> refers to combat. So while angampora 
              means the martial use of the limbs without the use of weapons, it is also divided into four main categories:
            </p>

              <li>

              <li>
                <strong>Locking & Gripping Techniques (Gata Haramba)</strong> – Punching and Tapping range

            </ul>
            <p>
              Some Martial arts experts and researchers recognize angampora as a complete martial art
              that can utilize all four fighting ranges.

              In theory, the master prompts his students to build themselves physically and mentally strong, self-disciplined, which requires them to harness a ritual form. Like peacocks brandishing their plumage to show their agility and speed, the student’s training in angampora aims to perfect the body’s readiness.

              These techniques are taught in the form of movement sets that include different combinations of stances and blocks with the relevant footwork. Students are taught these sets of movements, from basic to more advanced variations.
